# Themed Clock

This is a simple conky setup with a lua script that reads svg theme files from cairo-clock and renders them using conky.

**Only 12h clock faces are supported!** But I guess if you need a 24h setup, it should be easy enough to adjust the angle calculations.

The sample svg files in the subfolder Timex are from https://www.pling.com/s/Gnome/p/1349478. Thanks to BRETCOLIN for making them available. He published under Creative Commons, so be aware of this should you fork and/or copy the files.

_Enjoy!_
